MicroPosts app uses webpack and babel.
Got webpack and babel starter template from traversey github.

Babel is a toolchain thats mainly used for convert ES6 to ES5.
Webpack is a static module bundler, when it processes app it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module the projects needs and generates one or more bundles
In package.json the build script runs webpack, so npm run build runs webpack.

npm install         installs dependencies
npm run build       creates build folder with bundle
npm start           runs application

Bundle in build folder contains the same js code but converted/compiled to ES5.
In index.html our src is this bundle file.



npm install json-server     package.json dependency 
json-server used for creating a fake rest API

create a file custom named file db.json that will be the API
json-server --watch db.json           will start that server/API to use
added this command to "json:server" in "scripts" in package.json

npm run json-server             to start API server in a 2nd terminal

now have 2 terminals running, one for the app (npm start) localhost:8080, and one for the API (npm run json-server) localhost:3000


ONCE CODE FINALIZED
COMPILE EVERYTHING TO BUILD FOLDER
Build file is Production file 
Production file is what you want upload to server.
npm run build
