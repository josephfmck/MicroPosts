MicroPosts app uses webpack and babel.
Got webpack and babel starter template from traversey github.

Babel is a toolchain thats mainly used for convert ES6 to ES5.
Webpack is a static module bundler, when it processes app it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module the projects needs and generates one or more bundles
In package.json the build script runs webpack, so npm run build runs webpack.

npm install         installs dependencies
npm run build       creates build folder with bundle
